The strength of a link measures the number of papers sharing those two keywords, demonstrating keyword prevalence and their likelihood of co-occurring.\n*   **Research Gaps (4.3):** Topics such as Uncertainty analysis, Risk assessment, and Demand response have been less noticed or covered in less detail. The lack of connection between topics may indicate a lack of research or weak connections due to a small number of studies.\n*   **Main Topics in Energy Field:** Sustainable development, energy policy, energy efficiency, utilization and storage, and renewable energy resources are identified as the main topics in the energy field, which can be integrated with Machine Learning (ML) to create new possibilities.\n*   **Trending Areas:** Using ML-provided tools is suggested to significantly assist future research in trending areas to reach comprehensive results.\n*   **Journals in the Energy Field (4.4):**\n    *   Research about any topic is initially published in innovation-focused journals like *Nature* and *Science*.\n    *   After initial introduction, specialized journals publish research results on these topics in more specific usages.\n    *   Most recent publications in the energy field have appeared in journals such as *Energy Storage*, *Advances in Intelligent Systems*, and *Chemical Engineering Journals*.\n    *   This trend suggests that intelligent systems with electricity storage capabilities are being approached from various aspects.\n*   **Top 5 Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPCs) (Table 4):** The top CPCs for machine learning in the energy field include \"G06 N Computer systems based on specific computational models.\"\n*   **Top Assignees, Inventors, and CPCs in Machine Learning in Energy (Fig. 17):**\n    *   Top assignees include Colin Billings (1%), Mehul Desai (0.9%), Charles Howard Cella (0.8%), and James K. Baker (0.8%).\n    *   Top CPCs are G06N (56.4%), G06F (35.4%), G06K (22.8%), G06Q (21.4%), and H04L (11.5%).\n*   **Data Coverage:** The data used for all figures covers the 2000 most cited and 2000 most recent papers for energy-related topics from 2010 to 2020. While the timetable scaling in some figures is till 2018 for better visualization, research from 2018 to 2020 is included, often shown with the same color as 2018 data (yellow)."

Recently, journals like *Energy Storage*, *Advances in Intelligent Systems*, and *Chemical Engineering Journals* are prominent, indicating a focus on intelligent systems with electricity storage capabilities.\n*   **Shift in Energy Focus (Figs. 10 and 11 comparison):** While renewable energies had a strong focus in the past (around 2016), there's a possibility this focus could shift in the near future, with ML playing a significant role.\n*   **ML Patent Submission (General observation):** There's a discussion about a potential declining trend in ML patent submission, but this is argued to be temporary, with an expectation of increased patent numbers in the future as ML explores new fields."
